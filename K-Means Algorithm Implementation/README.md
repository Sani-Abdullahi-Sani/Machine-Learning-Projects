**Implementing the k-means Algorithm**

*Description:*

This Task involves creating a Python program that implements the k-means algorithm with the following specifications:

- Number of clusters set to 3.
- Dataset hard-coded into the algorithm.
- Reads initial cluster centers from standard input.
- Runs the k-means algorithm and halts when centers converge.
- Computes the sum-of-squares error for the dataset with respect to the final cluster centers.

*Features*

- Assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center.
- Updates cluster centers based on the mean of assigned points.
- Removes empty clusters after updates.
- Outputs the sum-of-squares error rounded to 4 decimal places.
