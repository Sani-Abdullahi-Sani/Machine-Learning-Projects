**Implementing a Simple Neural Network**

*Description:*

This Task involves creating a Python program that implements a neural network with the following specifications:

- Input layer with 4 nodes
- Hidden layer with 8 nodes
- Output layer with 3 nodes
- Sigmoid activation function for hidden and output layers
- Weights and biases initialized to 1

*Features*

- Feedforward step to compute the network's output for given inputs.
- Sum-of-squares loss computation between the network's output and target values.
- Backpropagation method for updating weights and biases with a learning rate of 0.1.
